1,"Have not been able to access my account for a long time. I put in the right password, then they make me verify with a code sent to my phone, I put in the code, and it STILL says security cannot be verified. And who has time to sit on hold all day. Chat service is useless as well."
2,"I have been trying to obtain the 2023 fee Schedule and has has been nearly impossible. I have called, left messages, written letter and emailed them, not results. I am very disappointed because I am not able to update and complete the fee schedule due to this."
3,"Dental and prescription cover is good. Vision and Medical Need improvement. I bought the highest level I could in my company. All specialist are 80 dollars. UHC really tries to force the patient to use virtual appointment or Urgent Care. Their Optum Virtual care told me to wait an additional three day (7) if I still have a fever to then go to urgent care. They consider biopsy, a surgery and are taking from your high deductible (2-5k). When I complained, appeal was denied and the comments on the price said to use virtual care or urgent care. Really? Their customer services is nice yet all this is out of their hands. One of the worst insurances I’ve had."
4,"If you are looking into using All Savers Insurance for your employees, please look again. It is a complete rip off, doesn't cover anything for diabetics and the representatives will speak to you like a dirty dog. I promise the employees the money that will come out of their paychecks, whether their employer contributes or not, will leave them paying the majority, if not all, for everything. Be smart and look elsewhere or maybe even consider self pay options!"
5,"I have had United for several years. In January they outsourced approvals to Evicore. Basically they are the middle man who denies everything and makes you appeal it all. United is using them as a scapegoat to blame for denials. I have never had an issue with meds or procedures. In one month they have denied meds I have already been on for years. Also, denied me for an MRI because my pain has become worse. They advised it was because I haven't been to therapy for at least 6 weeks. Therapy for what. They can't fix something when they don't know what's wrong. I was told by Envicore not to worry. Have the doctor complete the ""APPEALS"" process (correctly) and it should be approved. So, in short. United blames Evicore who then blames the doctors."
6,"I paid for COBRA for 18 months to avoid Obamacare. Now I see that I was right in doing so. Working with an agent in the Marketplace, I was set up with United Healthcare. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Thankfully, I have to endure this silliness only 2 more weeks. Medicare is looming. First off, my 2022 plan (for only the month of December) was decent. Customer Service, on the other hand, was not. I was not familiar with having an HMO and asked them several questions. I didn't feel confident with the reps, so would call again and then again with the same questions...and received different answers. My last question (posed to just one rep) was whether a mammogram is covered under my 2022 plan. I was told that she wasn't sure, but my plan in 2023 absolutely included this benefit, so I decided not to press further.So, it's now 2023 and I go for my mammogram. As I realized that it's a preventative care visit, and I was also assured that it was covered, I had no concerns. That is until the gal at the hospital told me that it's NOT covered. Naturally, I was taken aback, further disillusioned with UHC, but realizing that Medicare starts soon, so I just resolved myself to move on.Today I received a bill in the mail for the past two months' premium. I am a dog with a bone and previously called into the UHC queue a few times to MAKE SURE that I am on auto pay. They assured me that I was. I just checked their site (yes, I'm on auto-pay), then my charge card (yes, I've been charged). Unbelievable. I truly don't know why this company is rated higher than a zero."
7,"We, as I my husband and I have a 10,500 family deductible and 2500. Dollar deductible for each of us. Because I am not sick enough I can not meet my deductible, I do have severe double carotid stenosis with history of two heart attacks and a stroke. Because I can’t meet this deductible, my surgery is not covered. I would have to pay 100% of it. A life or death surgery. Which I can not afford."
8,"This insurance company is only concerned about saving money and not providing quality care when it is most needed - denying care after stroke events and expecting patients to pay for all medical care. Denial claims are worded to fit their bottom line. Requiring progress and then stating that they will stop coverage is counterproductive to any recovery or medical plan for a patient, especially when a patient has a half dozen doctors arguing with the insurance company about poor decisions and a patient’s need for quality care. They are happy to take your money but when quality care is most needed, this company fails miserably. They should be investigated."
9,"Made the mistake to switch to United Health Care Advantage this year. Their total lack of customer service is obvious: Either they don't pick up the phone, or whoever will answer the phone only speak a broken English, and you don't get anywhere. I had to file a complaint with Medicare."
10,"I changed my Medicare insurance to UHC starting January 1, 2023, what a disaster. First, I haven't received my member card yet, after almost 45 days. Called them three times, every time they are shocked and sorry but the same happens again. When I first called to inquire about their Medicare, my health insurance was with them and I was totally satisfied, the fast talking salesman promised the moon. He said that I would get a membership to a gym, that my eyecare is covered etc. I called back to confirm and the lady who answered the call confirmed. When I called and asked about how to join a gym, the rep said my plan used to offer gym membership but they ended it. When I called to get an eye exam, I learned that they only cover three physicians that no one had heard of and I could not find two of them on internet. The one that did have a website, had one pager phone number and address on it. Same horrible service with their drug plans, they called the wrong doctor to get my medications. Just a terrible headache. Their customer service phone is manned by untrained reps. I had to spend an hour and half to get my medication straightened out with them. What a waste, what a mistake, just horrible."
11,"I switched my drug plan to UHC from Humana -- biggest mistake since getting Medicare. Several of my drugs aren't covered and UHC's formulary gives an alternative drug -- NOT a generic. To get the original Rx my physician needs to submit a ""prior authorization."" Isn't the FACT that my physician prescribed the drug a ""prior authorization""!?!? When I called 'customer service' (and I use that term loosely) the person that answered did not speak English as their first language. I asked to be transferred to a US person and they did. However, when that person put me on hold to ""gather more information"" I was disconnected. I called back and was told by the second person their ""supervisors advised them NOT to call back if disconnected due to the volume of calls they receive"". Rest assured I will be switching back to Humana as soon as I can."
12,"I became a member of a UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage Plan January 2023. Observations: Customer Advocates are located in another country. They have not been trained. I've made several calls and have spoken to several reps who simply do not know how to answer simple questions. Very disappointing. Have since been provided with a number with US based reps. Problems with ID Card/U Card. Currently waiting for 4th card as the prior cards had errors. Unable to use U Card benefits due to multiple errors in card generation. Website and app do not work properly. Various messages appear and will not load information. After having the plan for less than 2 months, I'm considering changing to another plan with another company. It's very disappointing to expect actual service from a large corporation as UHG. This has been the worst experience for me with a Health Care company. I had a commercial plan prior to this plan with absolutely no issues. Why is the Medicare side of UHG seemingly so incompetent?"
13,"I have been trying to use my new UCard to purchase healthy products and make utility bill payments. UHC sent me multiple UCards with the wrong doctors' information and bar codes that didn't work. Their online bill pay system has all the WRONG information and don't allow customers to manually enter the correct information. Their ** customer service agents are not only incompetent, they don't understand anything and even need simple things like DALLAS spelled out. They are unprofessional and intentionally give customers a hard time. I have a recording with the agent and her colleagues giggling in the background. When I asked to be transferred to a U.S. agent, they pretend to be concerned, put you on hold for more than 30 minutes, then hang up on you. They are in collusion with Walmart for the bill payments to collect the fees and make things extremely frustrating for seniors. This is NOT a good use of a ""benefit."""
14,"I have been a UHC customer for 5 years. Evidently they have gone overseas with their customer service. When you call, if you can understand them, they cannot explain your benefits to you! I have to make multiple calls and either get multiple answers or the answers do not make any sense. For example, I was calling about a diagnostic procedure where they inject ** into my back and if they perform this procedure two times and I get 89% relief each time then they will do a nerve ablation.They told me my copay, according to the insurance is $52 for my portion. I called to verify this and neither person I spoke to could explain this. One of them kept referring to my drug plan. Then they told me I had to pay 20% of the procedure. When I asked where they found that they said I have to pay 20% on all of my medical. Which I know not to be true! This is a common thread that runs through UHC anymore. I will be changing insurance next year. It is too frustrating to deal with them any longer! It’s a shame because they use to have such good Customer Service!"
15,"I bought glasses in which they said I was approved but for my portion. Paid my portion and just received a bill approx 4 times the amount more than I originally paid as far as my portion. As far as that one said one thing and the other said another. In other words whose fault. No answers. Ok, my review is toward United Health Care. I’m speaking to them I asked them besides who’s right and wrong in issue of my bill what does plans cover. I see it states up to 200.00 and they only paid 112.86 out of 487.00.Be advised that when they are billed they pay for basic glasses. In reality they only pay 112.86 for glasses not up to 200. I looked on UHC site for this info. If you get more than they cover in which you better call first because they don’t state it you will be stuck with a much higher bill. I told them we are retired on fixed income and there needs to be clarity, not hidden costs. I’m stuck paying 312.30 for a 487.00 dollars for a pair of glasses not 67.00 which was told to me. Call UHC before you buy glasses because it’s not as stated."
16,I waited to give my rating and was put back in the queue. The agent didn't understand me very well and I had to repeat myself several time. I told her she could not understand me and she asked me to repeat myself again.
17,"Dealing with insurance is a notoriously bad experience but these guys take it to a new level. We have been jumping through hoops answering and re-answering questions, filling out forms, providing information just to find out why something is not covered. We still don't have our answer. If my employer provided an option to use a different provider I would jump at the chance. NOT RECOMMENDED. Customer service is perhaps the worst I've ever experienced."
18,I started This process is January and now it's February. They don't have my information. They don't know nothing. I have to turn in paperwork that you didn't tell me now I have to redo my application because now that I know it's too late so I have to redo this again. Wow. This is crazy. Communication is terrible. Will not recommend this to anyone else. Too much of a hassle.
19,"It is 6 weeks and have not received U card. Worst customer service after calling them 7-8 times providing misleading untruthful information. Not providing automatic review after customer service. Asked to speak to supervisor and was told it is Friday they leave early or will call back today, never to hear from them.They have robotic response as though reading from script, are from Philippines. Every time they say, ""We will issue a duplicate"" and next time you call they say, ""No one has issued duplicate let me order today."" They delete call log and disconnect the feature to leave a review after the phone call. Most inefficient service that cannot get a simple job of issuing a card get done. Every time they ask to wait 2 weeks to get the U card and never sent anything. It is 7 weeks and no response yet."
20,"I have a short term disability policy with United Healthcare. I never thought I would need it. Now that I do, I can't get them to pay. I wish I could give United Healthcare zero stars. They will do anything to keep from paying claims. I had to request forms from them 3 times before they were sent to me. Each time I spoke to someone they had no prior notes stating the forms were emailed or even requested by me. After my Dr filled out the forms and submitted them, my representative rejected the forms. Her reason was that the date of the absence could not begin January 5, the date my Dr. put on the forms. January 5 was the date of my Dr's appointment. How does an insurance company get to tell a Dr what he or she is supposed to put on a form? The representative said that the date must be December 30, because that was the first date that I missed work. OK, but this makes NO sense, because I didn't get in to see the Dr until January 5. I was not asking this company to pay me starting December 30. I just needed some portion of my income (50%) so that I could continue paying for my health insurance while I was sick and unable to work. I desperately needed the health insurance to pay for my ongoing treatment. If you have any choice, do not go with United Healthcare, my experience has been horrible. They are very nice when you call, but they do NOTHING to help you, even though they will tell you they are doing something. They will do anything to get out of paying for benefits they owe. Their representatives seem to be trained to delay, delay and delay. They also have no problem making the process as difficult as possible, regardless of how sick you are. Ultimately they will deny your claim and blame it on you for not providing the documents on time. Or, say you did not have the correct information on the documents."
21,"My prescription was 50$ for months. UHC then decided that they want me to use their online pharmacy, Optum so they jacked the price at my pharmacy to $500 to force me to use their pharmacy. I spent every day for a week trying to get it transferred only to find out that they don't even have the medicine in stock. I am now 2 weeks without my medicine and I am on the verge of going to the ER every day. These practices literally put lives at risk and they are using extortion tactics to force me to use their pharmacy. UHC represents everything wrong with our healthcare system."
22,"The United Health Care OTC (over the counter) program has the worst CSRs I’ve ever encountered Never mind they can’t speak English, but they have no comprehensive abilities.. changing to another service."
23,"United Healthcare lists many doctors on their site as in-network that are, in fact, not in-network. Then they reject claims to those doctors. I called over a dozen doctors, and was told each time that my insurance was not accepted despite the listing on uhc.com. Finally, I found an in-network doctor over 50 miles and an hour drive from my home. After my appointment, the claim was rejected as out-of-network.In trying to remedy this, I was left on hold for ""2 minutes"", which was much closer to 20. I was read a very well-rehearsed script about how I can appeal the claim, with the entire burden placed on me to resolve whatever paperwork issues they claim to be having with their claims department. That turns out to be impossible: the link to the appeal form on their site is dead. I get ""Bad Request"" from ""Apache/2.4.38 (Debian) Server at prod.member.myuhc.com Port 80"". I advise anyone in NJ having problems with United Healthcare to go straight to ** and file a complaint there."
24,"As soon as I went on COBRA coverage from my prior employer with the EXACT same plan, filing claims and trying to get medical supplies for a Type 1 diabetes became a nightmare. It's like they found out I wasn't going to have coverage for that much longer and decided to make it as difficult as possible to file a claim. They started requiring all sorts of clinical notes and pre-authorization for diabetic supplies. THERE IS NO CURE FOR TYPE 1 DIABETES. Now all of the sudden they need new doctor information to approve supplies I have gotten for years. Unbelievable."
25,"Updated on 02/18/2023: I notified United Healthcare's Chief Executive Officer of my 1/23 review in a 1/25 email. And, in a 2/17 email notifying the CEO of an unresolved issue & new problems I invited their response to my review.Original Review: They have not furnished me with results for a Colon Cancer test which their vendor lab got 12/23/22. This is after I called their representative Optum on 1/12/23. Besides Optum not getting back to me, Optum had an outdated address for me. Note: I notified United Health twice of my current address. United Health sent me a Colon Cancer test kit after I called them on 10/12/22  to tell them I already had a Colon Cancer test kit."
26,"The 1-866 customer service number is worthless. The majority of agents are not capable of answering your questions. Some agents do not have the skills to comprehend your questions. I have been told multiple times my Medicare Advantage plan will pay 100% of my routine dental procedures at an out of network dentist. (Payments will are capped at $1000 per year.) NOT TRUE! Like most insurance plans, there is a maximum amount insurance will pay to any out of network service provider for ALL procedures. Today I tried to address this issue with a ""supervisor"". She tried to tell me how the plan works (again). It took a while, but she finally understood I was calling to complain about agents giving customers inaccurate information. She said she would file a complaint. She never said the problem would be addressed or corrected."
27,Avoid United Healthcare. My doc sent an Rx to UHC’s pharmacy benefit mgr. (My UHC and PBM accounts are current.) The UHC PBM refused to fill the Rx. My doc then sent the Rx to a local retail pharmacy who had no problem filling the Rx.
28,"Since joining UHCare, I've been having issues with understanding the people that answers their phones with this pharmacy. Besides the outgoing message it's very hard to understand these people. They need to speak English better."
29,I was just astonished to find that the United Heathcare prescription plan endorsed by AARP did not cover a standard blood thinner (Eliquis) which is prescribed widely due to its safety for seniors with AFIB and blood clotting disorders. So now I must pay over 450.00 per month for a prescription that is commonly prescribed for this issue. I cannot understand how AARP who is suppose to represent seniors could endorse this substandard prescription plan. I am very disappointed for this stain on AARP’s reputation.
30,"I'm being denied a request for medication based on the fact that I haven't tried a cheaper drug that United Health Care/Optumrx wants me to try before being given the drug that my doctor prescribed me. My request was denied by a Jeffrey A. ** M.D. - a doctor that I do not know and that I do not have any communication with. Now I have to make an appeal so that this greedy and unregulated insurance company can save $300. Considering I have no other options through my employer, I am stuck with their services."
31,"Wanted to cancel overpriced short term health plan, because I got insurance through employment. Refused to cancel before the prepaid to date. Now I have to double pay health insurance for 1 month, no refund. This is theft, plain and simple. Stay Away!!!"
32,"They should change their name to United Denial No Care! They denied every single claim for over a year, including all ""covered"" maintenance. They could care less about you. All they care about is YOU paying their bottom line. They don't care 1 iota about our health! How this scan has more than 3 stars on this site should give you pause! DO NOT GO WITH THEM. THEY. WILL. SCAM YOU! Bankruptcy is at the end of this service for you, if you go with this scam!"
33,United Health Care only wants to be wealthy and not keep you healthy. They deny claims after 16 months with no explanation. I thought that surprise billing was illegal. They should not be able to retract from their financial obligations after a procedure. I pay my premiums and they are supposed to pay their part when needed. They are fraudulent. I am better off paying out of pocket and discontinuing insurance. Someone needs to put a stop to their scam. Do yourself a favor and stay away from Untied Health Care!
34,"Even if you can prove you have received faulty contacts, they want you to return each faulty lens before you can get a refund. How am I supposed to do that if I have dailies? Open each individual contact lens case and test them? Then I ruined all the good contact lenses while testing to see if they were faulty or not. Not all the contacts were faulty and I don't have the option of glasses at the moment. It is an unreasonable policy and discourages returns despite faulty product. They want your money and will go to the most painful lengths, (yes, even keeping you blind) to keep your money. They no longer have my business, they practice in bad faith, and I don't recommend anyone utilize their services because they DO NOT have your best interests at heart and DO NOT care about you or your problems."
35,"I met my deductible and out of pocket minimum for 2022. I double checked with UHC to make sure my deductible and out of pocket max are from Jan 1 - Dec 31 because I needed to have surgery in December, they confirmed that was correct. Our policy renewed on Dec 1. My deductible went up 250.00 and my out of pocket went up 450.00 for the next year - I knew that and get it - But now they have added that 700.00 increase to the deductible and out of pocket max to my totals that I have already met for this year for December and it won’t even apply for the next year because it all resets in Jan. This is theft, stealing, scam, what ever you want to call it. I can’t believe a company could be this smarmy, it’s sickening. I called customer service three times today, two of the times the person on the other end couldn’t understand the problem. I asked for a supervisor and waited on hold for 30 min. When I finally got one she said patronizingly (I’m sorry, that’s just how it works). I am so sick of ** like this from UHC."
36,"I am a severely disabled individual. I signed up with UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage because my disabilities require the extra benefits they provide. I have been with them for 4 months, and have made countless phone calls to them about various things. I have never be treated SO POORLY by customer service agents. I even tried to file a grievance against one and they refused to provide me with any kind of copy or proof of the grievance (despite assuring me that I would get it at the beginning of the process)!I'm in the process of contacting corporate because I know from friends and family that my experience is not unique. These agents are uneducated - uneducated about the needs of the disabled community, uneducated about more than just the basic things concerning insurance, and uneducated on how to effectively listen and communicate. Some of them have been dishonest and disrespectful. Most of them have no care or compassion for your needs - even when the needs are to keep your body alive. Unitedhealthcare's insurance and benefits are EXCELLENT, but dealing with their advocates and agents is a nightmare that generally leaves me in tears."
37,"They have rejected 3 valid claims only to revert their decision after escalating the issue. I had to record the phone call to escalate it and get some attention to the same. This is very frustrating, because every time a claim is denied, it takes two to three hours to get in touch with them and get the issue resolved. Why are they denying valid claims in the first place. Horrible customer experience."
38,I was requesting for my new prescription and was always declined. Made several call to Angela for 3x about their request of prior authorization and so I need to call my physician many times and immediately they took the action of providing prior authorization thru the number of their FAX machine.. But Optum Rx keep saying non was receive for 3x of follow-up. I made another call this time at 1514 11/28/22 to ** (who said it's illegal for him to give his last name). He said the same thing again. That they need a prior authorization. I was also billed for 3 items when in fact I only received 2 items.
39,"I have had a very bad experience with this company regarding a disputed claim and the unwanted barriers this company has created to solving the problem. My disabled 89 year old mother is on UHC insurance and we have a disputed claim involving nursing home care. I pay nearly all of my mother's medical bills so this affects me enormously.During early October of 2022 Mother suffered a fall and injured her hip. She was hospitalized for 4 days, then discharged to a nursing home. While at the nursing home she contracted an illness that caused her to vomit. She was hospitalized again and diagnosed with COVID. She stayed at the hospital for 3 days and was released back to the nursing home for a period of time.I was lied to and misled regarding the nursing home coverage. A totally unexpected bill for 8 days of private-pay nursing home care arrived in the mail. The bill was for over $1100. I was previously told that the 20-day clock for nursing home care restarts when there is re-hospitalization for another condition not related to the original medical problem. This is what the government Medicare office says is true. However the insurance company processed it differently and refused to apply the reset of time.I ran into very thorny problems attempting to contact UHC regarding this problem. I soon found that I could only talk to sales people who are trying to sell new policies. They transfer you to the claims department. Then you get a recording saying that there is no one available for you to talk to in the claims department. You have to go online to contact the claims department. You go online and they route back to the same worthless customer service number you just called and to Facebook and Twitter. What good is Twitter? If you don't have a Facebook account you can't contact them. It boggles the mind why they won't let you contact them from your Gmail account regarding such problems when they also won't let you talk to anyone in the claims department via telephone."
40,"We've had UHC AARP Medicare Rx and Medicare Supplement plans since 2015. I recently tried to update my autopay checking account because of fraudulent activity affecting my old account. Nightmare!! UHC's website does not open on my PC, so I spent 35 minutes on the phone with an agent updating Part D Rx autopay. There is absolutely no excuse for this level of time commitment just to change an account number! I received a confirmation and payment was processed by my bank.Since each type of account requires interacting with a separate department, I had to contact UHC again to change the account on my Part B Supplement. After a 24-hour sanity break, I called again and spent another 30 minutes on the phone with the separate Supplement Part B plan agent to update my checking account number for that autopay. I have a confirmation number, but the bank has not shown any request for payment. I have no idea where the transaction is sitting. I still have to call the Reimbursement department to update my account for deposits of my employer's reimbursement funds. And I need to try again to get technical support for the website issues. I simply cannot face a follow up call plus another 2 phone calls with them!! My guess is that their sales department is quick and efficient in answering phone calls, but God help you if you need actual customer support. I don't know how a company can be so insensitive to customer needs."
41,"I completed an application for a United Healthcare Supplement Plan G on 7/27/2022. I was losing my employee health insurance benefits on 8/31/2022. My application was accepted and I was issued a Membership Effective 9/1/22. I went to my doctor for a routine checkup on 9/26/22 and blood work on 9/16/22.I was told that I did not have proper insurance at my doctor's visit. The blood work was not questioned. I received a bill of $306.02 from my doctor and $564.78 for the blood work. In checking why I was billed it was explained by Medicare that Part B was never arraigned for by anyone. They also said the application should have been denied. When I contacted United Healthcare they apologized and terminated the policy. I then called Medicare to sign up for Part B effective 11/01/2022.When I called another insurance company to add an advantage plan they cannot make it effective until 01/01/2023 because technically I did not have insurance for 60 days. Yet I had a policy and was paying a premium. United Healthcare should never approved the policy, which so far has costs me $870.80 to date. This does not include the premium. Thank You, Vincent"
42,"I have Medi Cal and Medicare and was trying to enroll with UHC and they told me I could keep my same Dr. then when they called me to verify my enrollment they had assigned me a Primary Care Dr, I'd never heard of, I told them their representative had told me I could keep my same Dr, and they said I couldn't so I immediately disenrolled, they kept me on hold for 48 minutes... What a pain. Hopefully no one else gets caught up in their lies."
43,This insurance SUCKS.Read the other reviews.UH is complete trash.Customer service is garbage Good luck getting anything coveredTried to use when I needed it most. Everything was denied .This insurance is perfect if you just want to waste your money and never ever get sick!!!! Otherwise run away from this disgusting fake insurance company
44,Nobody knows what they're doing. I have spent more time on the phone with them than I ever have had to with a insurance company and got zero issues resolved. Their ppc referral plan is the absolute worst. Don't waste your money or time with it
45,"I found UHC to be extremely difficult to work with. In fact, the worst insurance companies we have EVER dealt with. There is no clear explanation of coverage when a UHC representative is asked. On SEVERAL occasions, I was told one thing (with regards to coverage), then when the claim was made, it's now suddenly different. We are also passed from department to department and have difficulty getting a straight answer - at that. We are Expat Insurance members, and several times I've received a reply back from UHC saying: ""Please MAIL (?!!) your claim to this American address"". Do you know how long it would take to mail something to a PO BOX from overseas?? This is constantly a problem. Local departments dealing with International claims. Also, sensitive documents seem to become ""lost"" over at UHC. For example, I submit a claim with all the supporting documents, and then I have a request to RE-submit these documents again. Where are these personal SENSITIVE documents going? Are they being intercepted by a third party? Overall, I would NEVER recommend UHC to anyone as there are serious disorganization problems within UHC and sensitive documentation is being lost."
46,"We have had UHC for several yrs through our employer. They are the worst health insurance companies we’ve ever experienced!! The most untrained unprofessional and rude reps. Long hold times - MANY times I am finally disconnected or they just never answer! And I’ve been hung up on when I press them on something they don’t know the answer to. Another game is they will say they are transferring me to a “supervisor” or “level II rep” when I ask to escalate due to them having no clue how to service my request - I will hold for 15-45 min and then am disconnected. HORRIBLE! They do not know what they are doing and if they say they are transferring you just hang up. They show no apology for being hung up on or hold times in excess of 25 min. They simply don’t care and NO ONE at the top cares or they would appropriately train their service reps. Also every rep will tell you a different thing- so document date and what they said and employee #. Go do a search on the unethical fraudulent background of the leaders of this company. UHC tops the list for consumer complaints. I am in the midst of fighting them on a common sense claim they are sending me through circles on. And no one seems to k on why it isn’t being covered and the phone call drops after them trying to find a supervisor to help me. I asked them to have a supervisor call me directly due to the HOURS I’ve spent on this and they say that’s against their policy. Other excuses I’ve gotten is “for some reason I can’t pull that up”, “our system seems to be down”, “I’m not sure why but I can’t transfer you”, “I’m sorry that you were on hold for 15 min. We don’t usually do that"" (followed by a 30 min hold time and a disconnect!!). They are designed and taught to play dumb, deny claims or pretend they never received them or that their system isn’t working correctly. We are dropping them at open enrollment and have reported back to HR how abysmal their service is."
47,Sadly we don’t have another option of healthcare to choose from from my husband's corporate work otherwise we would switch. The PPO is no better than an HMO. Seems like every one of our treasured drs either doesn’t carry United Health Care but seems to carry Blue Cross and Blue Shield PPO or they are dropping UHC due to not getting reimbursed enough in comparison to the other PPO insurances. I feel like we have healthcare yet we’re paying out of pocket for every dr. It would make more sense to go concierge at this point and know we will at-least get quality care physicians.The UHC website has not been updated in a very long time. There are drs on the list of in network providers that have dropped the insurance and they're still showing up as in network. I can’t say worse things about how awful this insurance is in comparison to the other PPO plans. You're better off getting Blue Cross/Blue Shield PPO. At least you’ll have more options for quality care physicians. Absolute incompetence with the people you have to deal with. No one knows what they're talking about. It’s like banging your head against the wall dealing with dealing with people at United Health Care. Go elsewhere if you're able. You won’t regret it.
48,"worst medical carrier ever. This is an employer provided program. Denied Covid test even though test performed in an in network hospital. In addition, they decided that a provider was ""partially"" out of network and paid 1 item and denied two. Again, procedure performed in an in network hospital. They still claim they are correct. I would never voluntarily purchase coverage from them."
49,"My daughter had to have hip surgery in summer of 2021 due to chronic hip pain. United Healthcare paid some claims and then decided to deny one of the procedures done as part of the surgery, claiming it wasn’t “medically necessary.” Ya tell that to my daughter who is now pain free for the first time in years. They left us on the hook for an additional $5,000 over and above the thousands we had already paid for the surgery. I spent hours and hours on the phone with UHC and each time it was a different story, ranging from “the hospital billed it incorrectly, just have them resubmit,” to the procedure was not “medically necessary.” Finally, I submitted an appeal of their denial on the claim. They are required to respond with a decision in 60 days. After that date passed, I spent more hours and hours on the phone with them asking about the appeal. In the end, it took them over 3 months to tell us that they are denying our appeal. No big surprise there, just more wasted time. They had some doctor who works for them write the denial. Here’s an example of one of his sentences, word for word “There are no records submitted that establish the doctor treatment surgically was done of this and the rare no records submitted establishing the diagnosis of the snapping hip.” I guess when you’re not good enough to actually practice medicine as a doctor, you go to work for the insurance company denying claims. Clearly, you don’t even need to be able to write in complete sentences to work for UHC. I have no idea what he’s trying to say here, but let’s assume it’s that the surgeon performed a procedure for an issue that my daughter wasn’t diagnosed for. Huh, the surgeon is really going to do that and I’m actually going to let him, I don’t think so. Where do they get these people? Now they claim we have to file a second appeal before we can take it to an external appeal. They clearly want to drag their feet for another 3 months or more. An external appeal is where someone other than UHC gets to decide what’s “medically necessary” and that’s what they want to avoid. Like all unethical big businesses, they are clearly just trying to wear down the consumer until we give up.Well we didn’t give up. Finally, after multiple appeals, delays, and roadblocks during an almost a year-long battle with UHC we got the chance to file an external appeal. Guess whatthey overturned the UHC denial of our claim. I guess all it took was a real doctor who doesn’t work for UHC, from an Independent Review Organization taking an impartial look at the evidence to decide that the procedure was totally appropriate and should be covered.Finally UHC will have to pay for the procedure and we’ll start to get our money back. Unfortunately there’s no penalty for their actions, no compensation for the weeks and weeks’ worth of my time spent researching and preparing appeals. They will keep fraudulently denying claims and ripping off health care consumers. This company is ethically and morally bankrupt and their only mission is to make a buck off of people’s illness, not help people. Need proof? Just look at their QUARTERLY profits measured in BILLIONS of dollars. Yet they refused to pay our $5,000 claim. In the end, it really feels like some thief stole $5,000 from my family and then made me play some sick stupid game over the next year in order to get it back. That thief is very real and it’s United Healthcare!"
50,"Worst health insurance company ever. If you don't send an appeal letter, they will refuse or try not to pay for the procedure. It's like the insurance representative is better than your doctor. Most of the dental services they don’t cover even when you in so much pain and with doctor’s letter. Heartless company."
51,"I'm 67 years old. I've had plenty of experience trying to get payment on claims from different insurers. United Healthcare stands in the #1 position in my own personal Hall of Shame for healthcare insurers. When filing my own claims (presumably because the Drs offices don't want to deal with the ** this company deals out so generously) it takes 30-60 BUSINESS DAYS to process them. Then another 10-14 BUSINESS DAYS to get a check to you. Then, when I call to check up, I get someone who reads what's on the computer about the claim that has been proven to be WRONG EVERY TIME! The claim has been 'escalated'. I thought that meant it would be noted as a priority! Apparently it was on an escalator going to the bottom of the pile. On June 23, I was told I would get a call from a supervisor the NEXT DAY. Well, it's July 17 and I'm still waiting. Sheesh. HORRIBLE, SHAMEFUL, ABSENCE OF INTEGRITY AND EITHER SUPREMELY DISORGANIZED or FLAT-OUT LIARS."
52,"I was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer (stage 2b). They (United Healthcare, a/k/a UMR, Accolade), delayed my radiation treatment because they denied pre authorization, at first, until my oncologist called them. Now 2 months after radiation they are denying payment, saying there was no pre authorization? Makes no sense. We got prior authorization, in fact, treatment was late because we had to wait for the pre authorization! And now we have a bill for over 14k because this company says there was no pre authorization? It’s horrific to go through cancer treatment and then to have the nightmare of this insurance company constantly betraying your trust. This is what we paid for? I just wanted to warn someone, anyone. If only my husband and I had known how truly treacherous this company was."
53,"First I wasn't advised that since I applied on or after the 15th of the month, the coverage is not reverted to the 1st day of the month. The coverage isn't even started on 06-27-22, when the payment was verified as received by United Healthcare. Because I applied on 05-24-22, the coverage didn't start until 06-01-22. I could have gone bankrupt waiting for the coverage to start if I had to go to urgent care or the hospital. When I call and reach out-of-the-country customer service, there is never a resolution to any issues I raise. Also, while the voice integrated system indicates a survey follows the customer service, because United Healthcare stars in review is around 1.6, no survey comes on the line. Finally, immediately after I received coverage I had to wait to see what doctors, urgent care, and hospitals to go to past 06-01-22, when the coverage started. These doctors, for instance, may or may not accept not accept new patients."
54,"After having a stroke and being in the hospital, I contacted customer service to inquire about my coverages. I received 3 different answers to the same coverage questions by 3 different customer reps. After leaving the hospital with a heart monitor I called again to check my coverages for the unit. I was told by the same rep the unit was covered, then told it was not covered and then was told I was covered in the same conversation minutes apart.After asking for a supervisor I explained to her I have been given false health coverage information from several customer reps and made some poor decisions because of it, she just said, ""Sorry"" and then asked if there was anything else I needed. I said, ""Yes. Would you please listen to my previous 6 calls I made to the reps"" to prove to her the false coverage information I was given.. She stated only certain people can do that. (As a supervisor it is her duty to get to the bottom of misinformation.) She then asked if there is anything else I needed. I stated, ""I will not renew my coverage with UHC when enrollment period returns due to your corporation's poor and false coverage details.."""
55,"Since the fist day I started with this company I been experienced the worse customer service. All visit to doctors, laboratories and pharmacy have been issues and issues to be covered! I am an HIV patient and they push me and push me to change my medication after been on it for the last 8 years (with no issues with Florida Blue Cross), they do not care about health, they just want your money. They claim pharmacy rush appeals will be handled in 72 hrs, and is a TOTAL lie, they start to handle them AFTER the 72 hrs, meaning a prescription that is urgent can take more than a week. At the end my doctor find for me 6 months of medications supplies because he got exhausted of calling (with me on the phone) with no luck to receive at least an answer. Be aware of finding another insurance when you have to renew or find a new company, THINK TWICE before choosing United Health Care."
56,I have deep vein thrombosis in both legs and now compression stockings no-longer work and after suffering an injury to my ankle and unable to walk found a vein specialist to assist. I've yet to gain approval for remaining treatment and suffering with extreme pain and I can't wear shoes. Rely on cane and getting tired of the excuses. At this point in time I've begun the process of searching for a new provider and would not recommend UHC to anyone. I need to work but due to current situation can't and I feel UHC is not listening to me.
57,"I don’t usually leave online reviews but I feel it is my duty to warn others how vile and evil this organization is. While they routinely deny cataract surgeries or even an OBGYN checkup, their CEO and mid-tier MBAs make bank at the expense of their consumer’s health. Don’t even bother calling customer service or complaining to your state. The hand-in-glove corruption knows no bounds. How on Earth this corporation is legal confounds me. Evil personified. Horrific."
58,"After over 4 hours of calling United Health Care to enroll in a plan, getting transferred 7 times throughout my various calls, being placed on hold for periods of up to 40 minutes, and talking to agents that communicated as if they were on drugs, not one of them had the capability to handle a simple call, to provide basic information, nor to enroll me.After this nightmare, I called the corporate office and asked to talk to management. I briefed the receptionist on what had been taking place, and said that I had to bring my experience to their attention. Just as all of the other employees I had the misfortune to talk to, this corporate office receptionist said that she was going to transfer my call to a ""Sales Agent"". She immediately transferred and left the call without allowing me to say anything, even though I had been very clear when she answered that I needed to talk to someone in management, because of all that I had been going through for almost 5 hours of trying to get help and not getting it. Turns out she transferred me to an automated message that said: ""Please enter your writing ID"". What in the world is wrong with the employees at United Healthcare????I dialed the corporate office number again, and another receptionist answered. This one asked for my name and said nothing else. I was waiting to hear that she was going to transfer me to a supervisor or manager, but after a few seconds of silence, the call was disconnected. Absolutely shocking!!!! And what's even worse is that there's no way for me to let the leaders know about what their employees are doing (and not doing) on their jobs. Very truly, every single one of them, and I must have talked to approximately 10 employees in a 4 to 5 hours period, displayed complete and total incompetence, disregard, carelessness, ignorance and disrespect."
59,"I needed to dispute a rejection of a charge from an out of network provider. They had me physically mail copious amounts of paperwork and then did nothing with it when they got it. I would call the special number to ask about it's progress and they would either say they couldn't find anything about it or they would lie and say it was still in process. It wasn't until 5 months later that I found out that they had me mail the paperwork to the wrong entity. Unbelievable. 5 months of lost therapy. I won't get those 5 months back. And they would just flat out lie to me to get me off the phone. I didn't pester them, I would simply call for status. They don't know their You Know What's from a hole in the ground."
60,"Never again! UnitedHealthcare will not approve necessary surgery procedure. My doctor had to present, argue, and fight for me. CEO is the highest paid CEOs. Doctor privately told me that UnitedHealth is the most difficult insurance to work with. I am leaving this plan as soon as enrollment period opens in November."
61,"I spoke with UHC on Mar 30 2022. Jaclyn gave me incorrect information. That caused me not to have a PCP for the month of April. Even though they know that their agent made a mistake they are not willing to correct the error. Bye UHC, Hello Humana. Do not use UHC."
62,"$450 a month and NOTHING was covered. No doctor visits, no annual lady visits, no meds....NOTHING. What in the heck did I pay $450 a month for!?!? This should be illegal and shut down. Nothing in the literature prior to picking a plan stated nothing would be covered under their more expensive plan. Do not get this insurance, it's a scam!"
63,Worst coverage!! They denied 3 of the 5 claims from my preventive wellness visit. This was after I called to make sure doc was in network and that the visit would be covered. I have had to call every week for the last 4 months due to issues of them denying coverage and then claiming something else. They also refused to give us our summary benefit coverage even after our employer called them and said they needed to provide it! It costs more money after a deductible has been met rather than less!! RIDICULOUS!!!!
64,"Adding rudeness to incompetence makes for a new low in UHC customer care. I, and other relatives, will likely not renew with UHC next year as a consequence. Briefly, I was told by my provider of a $345 estimated copay for a test procedure. I called UHC customer service to understand how that number was arrived at (and whether I should change anything such as facility...)The first “advocate” I got was totally unhelpful, left me on hold for 8 minutes with no communication and when returning with no useful information abruptly put me on “music on hold” as I was mid-sentence. That level of rudeness is simply unacceptable. I called again and requested to speak with a supervisor. The much more polite person contacted a supervisor and asked me to wait while in parallel trying to sort out my very simple request. 30 minutes later, she was still unable to provide useful information and no supervisor was still available. I asked for a supervisor call back. 24hrs later I am still waiting.Good customer service is more than relabelling agents as “advocates”.  It is                                                                                                Not leaving customers on hold for several minutes with no feedback.                                                                                                Not hanging up on a customer by rudely putting them on hold.                                                                                                Having agents (advocates they are not) be able to answer simple questions regarding the breakdown of a copay.                                                                                                Having supervisors available when a customer requests speaking with them. Having supervisors call back when requested to do so.I realize UHC treat customer care as a cost center whose cost is to be optimized... but I suggest they look at top-line cost of poor customer service as customers choose other healthcare providers."
65,"I purchased a Critical Illness policy over 2 years ago, before COVID. Last Oct I was hospitalized with COVID. I had Viral Pneumonia and blood clots in my lungs. My bill was almost 10k and my policy covered up to 40k. After about 5 months of submitting claims, they denied all payment! They said COVID was covered under critical care! I was furious! I've never been so disappointed in health care as I am today. Never ever get insurance through United Health Care!!"
66,"UHC is by far the worst customer experience I have ever had with ANY company. Period. And it was at the expense of my wife's mental health. Incorrect information given multiple times, un-ethical practices with changing coverage mid-year, hours on the phone, and appeals unanswered after weeks of being submitted. The only way I can understand that they are still in business is that they offer low prices because they absolutely do not care about customers and with health insurance laws we are helpless to make any changes outside of open enrollment. I am filing a formal ethics complaint with the my state."
67,"Almost every single day for the last year I have received junk mail for Medicare. I have called the company several times to be taken off their mailing list. I do not need, nor want, Medicare as I am a veteran and all my medical, vision, and dental needs are taken care of through the VA. Even one of UHCs that I spoke to was unaware of this and she said her husband and father are veterans. It's sad that I have to education one of your people. My last call was transferred to AARP. The call before that the representative was nothing but argumentative. When I asked for a supervisor she put me on hold for 13 minutes then disconnected the call. And you think I would even consider doing business with a company like this even if I needed/wanted Medicare? You are sorely mistaken."
68,"UHC Administration Staff are poorly trained, inconsistent, inefficient with answering questions about claims and processing claims. There are too many hands in the processing of claims making it very confusing for UHC and for the customer. I have 34 claims of out of network reimbursements since beginning of May 2021 and only receive reimbursement for 6 claims out of the 34 early on then as months went on nothing. UHC gave me lame excuses like their machine that takes the forms came out blurry on their end, or some went through processing and others didn't because certain reps got confused and denied some, then they need treatment records, then a weeks go by and need more info on the treatment records and it goes on. Almost like they do this to see if people will give up and they don't have to reimburse. I have spent 30+ hours including long calls and emails to UHC. I kept good notes and sent everything to the Commissioner of Labor and spoke to HR. Finally I think they are expediting my claims. I received one check for 3 claims. Now I just need about 20 more to be reimbursed. We pay a lot for our healthcare and NO one should ever have to go through this!"
69,"I had the unfortunate experience of having United Health Care for 8 months last year and it was the most negative experience I have ever had with an insurance company. My husband says watching me interact with United healthcare is like watching a real life Lifetime Movie. In short, United Healthcare looks to find any and every reason to deny coverage instead of helping someone who really needs it. Issue 1. I needed a minor procedure done. My doctor called United healthcare and gave them the codes for a procedure and the doctor was told it would be covered. So I made the appointment. United healthcare paid the claim and then reversed it citing the codes used as the issue. My doctor has appealed this twice since they used the same codes they initially called about, and United healthcare continues to deny it. I now have to pay for the procedure out of pocket. That cost is $800.Issue 2. I was in physical therapy and when my physical therapist's office called about the number of visits, they were never told of the policy that they had to submit a request for more visits at visit 21. The max you are allowed is 25 and apparently I went over by 1. United healthcare is denying my 26th visit citing their policy. My medical practice is charging me the full amount of the visit and claim they did their due diligence by calling. They told me I have to submit an appeal. I know from experience appeals get denied by United as I have had this happen on every occasion I have submitted something. So this is another $310 I will be having to pay a different doctor.Issue 3. I have hypermobility syndrome which means my bones just move out of place for good reason, bad reason, or no reason at all. There is 1 doctor in this area who treats this and they do not take insurance. I submitted a request for gap coverage since they are the only doctor who can provide the care I need. My gap coverage was denied, providing other doctors to see. I called their offices and they said they don’t treat hypermobility syndrome (the person who took my appeal information never put my primary diagnosis on the gap coverage). So I appealed it. And United still came back with a denial and more doctors' names in network I could visit. However, I called those doctors and they too said they cannot provide the treatments I need. I gave up with the appeals process since it was evident I would not make any progress here. So I submitted my bills as out of network claims. I have only submitted the first 3 of many, and I cannot even get these visits covered. They have been denied 3 times, citing coding does not comply with MARS. My doctor's office has said they have not had this issue with any other insurance company and have tried working with United Healthcare. My doctor's office said they thought they worked it out and resubmitted 2 of the claims on my behalf and they should be accepted this time. However, I just got another denial letter in the mail again citing coding. Bottom line, you will pay a lot of money and get nothing in return but headaches if you choose United Healthcare as your insurance. I had a different insurance company most of my life and I never had any of these types of issues with them. I have since switched back and am so thankful I did."
70,"I have been given false and incorrect information from United Healthcare Hearing time after time, including from a supervisor. After 7 phone calls, I am finally informed that yes, I was given false information more than once before, including from a supervisor. Sorry. That's it. They are incompetent."
71,"I'm pretty familiar with United Healthcare. I wanted to switch to mail-order. I had an old $30 balance & I was told that they would override the payment in order to get crucial medication until I was able get the payment from 7 yrs ago taken care of. The customer service representative are untrained in handling complicated calls. Instead of handling the call correctly they lied and said they override my payment for crucial meds. They're free anyways. This was a serious life threatening situation, and you'd rather lie and get me off the phone instead of handling the call. It's important to me that you care about your customers. Whatever you do represents United Healthcare. I'd fire the person that gave me false information, and me to think my situation was taken care of. I like the fact 7 yrs ago when I done the mail order pharmacy they were on time with the orders, but I start getting my packages taken.I feel this was an issue where they were too lazy to correctly respond to the call & giving me false info was one of the those ""Whatever I got to do to get her off the phone."". You don't play games like. I know you have your company policies, but never give false information. I needed those medications. As the days go by I'd pray I didn't have a stroke. I worried about how would I care for myself if that happened. I never ask for an override & the medications were free. So basically you lead me to believe you didn't care. You must care about your clients. That behavior was inappropriate & showed lack of empathy or sympathy. I will never forget this time of waiting. A complete nightmare. That wouldn't of cost you any $s. Just a little concern & empathy."
72,"United Healthcare Medicare plan told me I have Medical coverage in other states. As I got sick on vacation in another state I got a total bill, because united only covers home town/state. United also talked me in to schedule house call visit and to receive $70 in credit card. First visit person lied that she was there and she couldn’t been there, due to our dogs, plus I waited hours. United did not honor promise and had to rescheduled appt. Appt was beginning Nov 2021, now Feb 2022. After 2 complaints and 3 calls I still have not received card. United also told me I have free gym excess anywhere in USA which was so in 2021, but they no longer have silver sneakers and therefore only have gym in hometown and not where vacationing any longer. Dental benefits has also decreased and lose of coverage. Hearing aid coverage is no longer available. Customer service lied, gave me wrong info, and hung up on me at numerous calls to get info."
73,"Have had this insurance for years and now when I need the catheterization they are stalling. Case was marked URGENT and it’s been 14 days of stalling, miscommunication, and confusion on United’s part. Customer service tells me computers are not updating. Called again and said nothing was submitted. Doc said did submit. Third call took 56 minutes!! And was told now they want more info and a peer to peer call (as if my doc office has nothing to do but talk with them when they have 50 other patients to schedule.) Called again was told didn’t need ANY authorization due to cardiac issue. Still getting run around. When their staff forgot to put their phone on mute, I heard them say “This is why people are pissed at us. WE don’t even know what we are doing”. POOR Recommendation."
74,"I had a stroke in 2017, May. It took the right side out at 75% leaving me with left side foot drop and left arm negotiation problems. Recently I have been able to, with a walker, get up and down steps, mow my grass with a zero turn mower and get back to the woodworking shop. I had to explain to UHC via their support line why we thought Botox Shots would help, they finally said they would help pay for it. I was thankful for that help. Unfortunately it didn't help long term. It is a must to push yourself and trust yourself that it can be done. I don't know what I would do without UHC as they have helped me with other things also. Thanks for listening. Insurance under any circumstances is a must. Fortunately I am retired."
75,"Got a new account via the exchange. Can't sign in to new account because it defaults to old one. Been trying to get a hold of customer service for a week and a half. More than eight hours on the phone with various customer service agents from various departments, from old department to new one to IT to web services. No one can fix it. No one offers any kind of solution. At most they tell me to keep trying and maybe it'll be fixed next time. No solutions. They simply do not care."
76,"Medicare takes a big bite out of my income whether I choose UHC or not. The customer service even during Covid era, has been great, where other companies are extremely lacking. They haven't been able to lower my co-payments for specialist visits, but they do try to encourage me to maintain better health with $ quota of free OTC merchandise as well as bonuses for annual physicals and flu shots. I believe this company has been very customer focused when others have not."
77,High deductible plans have created the atmosphere that we feared the most. More cost sharing is not what the people wanted. We wanted more freedom to decide what health services we wanted and our physicians to decide what is needed. Some procedure are arbitrarily denied based on algorithms that were created based on conditions that don't necessarily apply for everyone. The human body is complex and should not be looked at as a one size fits all model
78,"Ask what's going on and you tell them, but they don't get it unless you are about to jump off a bridge or hurt yourself, if none apply it's like, ""How can we help you"" and but not if it was their family or love one. This alone may send you to the bridge to jump. All that's wants to be really answered is, ""Are you thinking about hurting yourself or someone."" In having started/had my own support group for women, there's a lack of understanding that someone's life in your hands could mean the difference between life and death for that person. I felt like I had no one to really listen to what I was saying [I'm mentally, emotionally and physically broken-exhausted]. WHO cares not many health care professionals. After that call it put energy back into my soul to try and help anyone man or woman to learn to encourage yourself because you never know who the other person on the other side of that line is or their intent. Are they getting you off the call for a break or lunch or the end of their day to go home. Are they there just to have a income or is it truly from their heart and something they enjoy doing. Have they ever experienced a mental breakdown, which not even required a ER visit. What was it like to truly lose someone that they loved with their whole earthly being. No most are beyond feeling for anyone that they don't know personally except their own, calmly thinking next. Yes they don't know us from Adam or Eve, they wouldn't know us if we walked right up to them. True therapist/counselors feel with their heart/mind and not their want to just take the next call although we wouldn't know it, but they are there looking you in your face watching your reactions. Not these persons, although there's some very good counselors whom you will never meet but they will always stay in your heart because of the empathy and kindness through their voice and voice only, because you never meet them. Everyone and anyone has to be mindful of the powers, we have within our selves without having to rely on persons whom may not have our best interests at heart and my call to the behavioral mental health department today brought it back to me full circle. I will never ever again give???? that power again, no matter my outcome, life or death. Only God has that will and power. My life good and/or bad means more to me than the paycheck???? makes off of having me as a client. I truly hope that the recording is pulled and listened to. Someone's family whom may have the fund's and ability to address these types of insults and injustice practices will not let it just go and their love one is no longer a part of this earthly world as a result of neglect on???? We have put an end to negativity when it comes to our health care and well-being. Good Luck as we all go about making better health care systems & plans. I wasn't really sure if I could use the name of the health care company so I removed it to try and be safe and make all aware of the powers we have within ourselves until we can get to trusted professionals with taught education to guide me along the way. Good emergency help is out there so keep a backup plan just in case you're ever in a mentally dysfunctional state of mind."
79,"BTW, I AM STILL SLEEP DEPRIVED. My prescription from my doctor was on 11/18/2021. It is now December 10th and UHC continues to block paying for it. THAT’S 28 DAYS. WTF? BTW, I AM STILL SLEEP DEPRIVED. Have been on the phone multiple times for hours trying to get United Health Care to approve payment on my prescribed medicine. Originally my doc wrote a script AND pre-authorization for ** to Walgreens pharmacy. Unfortunately, Walgreens errored and sent in a request to UHC for payment of a “generic” **. Good catch, or so I thought. After even more time spent on the phone with a UHC customer service rep last night, everything was supposed to be “Resolved”. He called Walgreens, explained the situation and said he verbally gave the go ahead. You can imagine my shock and anger when Walgreens put in the request for payment for ** to UHC this morning and it was DENIED. More phone calls. Then they just told me to START ALL OVER AGAIN. I’m to call my doctor and have her write the same prescription again and write the same pre-authorization. EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE THE ORIGINALS! BTW, I AM STILL SLEEP DEPRIVED."
80,"Health insurance world is complex and United Health Care Company makes it more convoluted. I UHC took my monthly premium payment of $1,349 and refused to cover a much needed double hernia surgery. I am attaching the ""paragraph"" in my United Health insurance policy that they are hanging their theory on for not covering the cost of my hernia surgery. They claim that unless it is an emergency hernia surgery is not covered. My condition met the criteria of emergency based on their definition. They define ""Emergency"" as defined as: 1.) recent onset and severity including but not limited to severe pain (my pain began and has increased over the last few months causing me to see Dr. ** for his professional medical advice), diagnosed and call for correction coming from a prudent layperson, (Dr ** would qualify...lol, and his recommendation is to take care of the condition sooner than later), failure of me addressing the issues can result in placing my ""health in serious jeopardy"" (Dr. ** told me that if I did not address this problem that it can become strangulated. Doctor **, and every article I read online, states that strangulation is serious and even life threatening.) Based on the above evidence and United's own definition for emergency I believe that this surgery should be covered but I was wrong. They stole over $13,000 in ten months from me and would not cover the needed hernia surgery. Should be criminal!"
81,I went to my in network dentist in october 2021 for dental work. United Health Care contract with my dentist expired in June 2021. Like I am suppose to know that!! Who terminates a contract in mid year. I spent over 2 hours on the phone trying go get them to pay. I had to pay out of my own pocket!!! I am running away from this company. Going to either anthem or devoted. They have better coverage anyway.
82,"United Health Care is surely the worst insurance company that I have ever dealt with. Their internal system is messy, they keep declining claims for random reasons that they never notify customers. When calling up, the customer service lady was extremely rude, spending time arguing with the customers, instead of listening and trying to help. Emails sent to them always got ignored and you have to call up to go through the worst customer service again. Their service surely ruins your day. Even when the claims were approved, their cover is extremely minimal. I'm honestly impressed how such a terrible company still can be in the business!"
83,"Over the course of the last couple of months, I have spent over 20 hours on the phone with UHC representatives in order to sign up for my extended cobra benefits. I have ALWAYS been the beneficiary of UHC insurance for my husband and me. Despite that, UHC had my husband registered as the beneficiary, I called to have this changed to my SS # and make me the beneficiary. I found out when I went to log in that they changed the data to my son's SS# and made him a beneficiary! He is not even on the plan!!!!As instructed I sent UHC operations an email to make the corrections again, with bolded, all caps type to fix this, and now I find the application switched back to my husband's SS#. I have never been able to speak to a manager, and coincidently, I have never been able to take the post-call survey in spite of waiting online after each phone call. I am currently on the phone with UHC this AM, for 55 minutes to try and get this resolved AGAIN. Extremely incompetent and unnerving that this is the company that is managing my healthcare benefits. BEWARE."
84,"After copious research, and having received multiple mailings from UHC since last March when they discovered I was on both Medicare and Level 1 MassHealth (Medicaid), urging me to enroll in their Senior Care Options (HMO D-SNP) dual eligible plan, I called them on 10/18 hoping to do just that. That day their CSR Rochelle told me a certified sales agent was going to call me. When that didn't happen, I called again on 10/26 at which time their CSR ""Malia"" made the same promise. Lacking any call by 11/5, I filled out a enrollment application at the UHC website and mailed it in.With no call to date, I contacted UHC on 11/16 and this time was introduced on the phone to a Josh who identified himself as a certified sales agent, but who claimed--despite the information at the UHC website and the multiple UHC mailings to me--that UHC offered no SNP plans in all of MA. Knowing he didn't know his job in that respect, but unable to get anywhere with him, I called again today and talked to a Demi who identified himself as a certified sales agent and who was most helpful in verifying most of my qualifications for the plan, but was nevertheless forced to transfer me to another CSR who identified herself as Chaniqua (sp?) who could only offer, she said, to make another appt. for a certified sales agent to call me.Doubtful from a month of experience that such a call back will actually occur before the 12/7/21 enrollment deadline, I called back a second time and talked to a CSR named Bonnie who could only promise the same. Still the UHC snail mail ads urging me to enroll continue to barrage my mailbox. Question: is UHC genuinely interested in my business? If not, why can't they at least call me back to tell me so? In the absence of a timely response from UHC, I am left with only one option in the next 20 days: go with one of the less preferred SNP plans of their local competitors such as Tufts or Commonwealth Care Alliance. Are you going to force me to do that, United Healthcare?"
85,Transportation by Modivcare is absolutely the worst people to schedule trips. They route our calls across seas and the people who book our Transportation. They never get it right and hang up the phone or transfer you to someone who can't help. It takes a 30 minutes sometimes 60 minutes to book a simple trip. I can't handle the unprofessional callers...
86,I work for a surgeon and getting surgery approvals for UHC is a nightmare. I recently had an urgent authorization for a patient needing immediate surgery. When I started the authorization I was told that it was started as expedited and that I would have an answer in 48 to 72 hours. That was a lie! It was never started as expedited. When I called to speak with a supervisor to find out why I was told that it was expedited when it wasn't the supervisor advised that it was and it was not.  I think she knew I was mad and just wanted me off the phone.When I called the next day because the surgery still had not been approved I was told that it had not been expedited and they would do that now and it would take 72 hrs before they received approval. I advised that was not okay because this was supposed to be expedited on the 27th of October and here it was 11/3 and it still has not been done. The rep advised that she would be able to get a supervisor which I at the time had requested. Keri the supervisor got on the phone and told me that she was not sure why the rep told me that this case was still pending because she showed it was approved. This was at 11AM. By 1PM I received a call from Scott the case manager working the case who advised that he was still reviewing the case and that it was not approved yet. He advised that he had just received the case this morning and it still was not expedited.I have been trying for five days now to get a rush put on this case and it has never been done. The patient's surgery is tomorrow and I have gotten nothing but the run around since day one. This is always the issue with any patient's that I am trying to get authorized and it is one constant lie after another from them. I would never recommend this company to anybody because they do not care about the well being of their patients. Worst Healthcare Company EVER!!! They do not care about the patients healthcare at all!
87,"We obtained pre-authorizations before using an in-network specialist. Nevertheless, for a month, they have denied our claims despite our having repeatedly sent them the payment receipts as well as scans and images of their own preauthorization letters. I’ve never before had such a disorganized and inappropriate customer service organization to deal with."
88,"I am a physical therapist in New York, and I have been in practice since 2000. I presently run several orthopedic practices in NYC, and we are out of network providers with United Healthcare. I am absolutely horrified at how unethical this insurance company has become in the past couple of years. However, 2021 has been the most abhorrent year, which is absolutely disgusting given the fact that we are in a pandemic and we healthcare workers are just trying to get by while taking care of the public. I am currently dealing with a number of claims that are being denied for various unbelievably unethical reasons. We are asked to submit notes constantly, which we upload as instructed on the United Healthcare portal, and then we are told time and time again that the notes ""were not received"" or ""were lost in the system."" We have spent countless hours on the phone with useless representatives, many of whom do not speak enough English to be understood, in order to try to sort out claims that should never have been denied in the first place. It is very clear to many of us healthcare practitioners that United healthcare workers are being instructed to ""make mistakes"" or deny claims in order to save the company money. Most recently, my claims are being audited and denied even after I have gotten prior authorization. When my biller calls to discuss this and to have the claims re-processed with the authorization number, the United representatives flat out refuse. Today, The UHC representative told my biller it was ""not her problem"" that the claims were processed incorrectly even though there was an authorization. WHAT!?!?Then this same representative literally hung up on my biller while she was trying to explain the situation. Of course I will be filing a complaint with the state insurance board; however, I hope this review serves as a warning to all individuals and companies who may be looking to use United Healthcare as their health insurance provider. To that I say RUN!! Run as far away as you can from this incredibly unethical company. They will charge you an exorbitant premium and deliver nothing on their end except empty promises. I truly do not know how the executives sleep at night knowing how deceptive their practices are, especially during a time when everybody should be working together in healthcare. We healthcare workers put ourselves on the front lines to keep America safe and this truly disgusting company is only adding to the stress we already face on a daily basis. SHAME SHAME SHAME ON THEM!"
89,My prescription went from $15 to $110.89 in one year. My zero deductible went up to $445. I am paying more out of pocket this year than I have in all the years I had this coverage put together. They change the tier and we pay the price. I have called. All I do is hold on. Representatives have no knowledge at all what or how to assist. If it was a choice I would have rated this plan a ZERO!
90,"I have worked for a Critical Illness Recovery Hospital (CIRH or LTAC) for 3 years. Our patients are referred from lower a level of care in hopes of receiving aggressive treatment to recover from an illness and regain their strength enough for rehab or return home. I would estimate nearly every UHC referral is denied by the insurance company. Even after P2Ps and Appeals (which take weeks), patients will die at the STAC. In my opinion, they consistently roll the dice with people's health to chance the patient might get better at a lower level, less expensive level of care, but I only time and time again see patients die while waiting for the appeal. All other insurances have reasonable responses within reasonable time to get the patient the treatment they need, while United Healthcare gambles with people’s lives to save money. Someone needs to be held accountable for these referral denials!"
91,"As a Disabled person, who has Mental Health Illnesses and Chronic Illnesses, my Healthcare is very important to me. I needed to find a Care Manager to assist me with finding Counseling Services plus Dental Services and A new Primary Doctor. UHC said they did all of that. I signed up with them and was immediately put into a Call BLOCK on my private cellphone where ALL my calls go to 1 unhelpful TINA S. who did nothing for me. NOTHING!I began trying to get the care I needed and could not find ANY PROVIDERS who would take UHC. Zero. I feel UHC has denied me the Crisis Counseling (5 Sessions) I have begged them for. I have begged them for Care Management. Instead they LIE AND LIE AND LIE CONSTANTLY. UHC does not provide ANY Case Management not to Me. Not ever. Zero counseling help. It appears they want to argue and control ALL of my private calls to make appointments. Everyone I talk to at UHC is in Atlanta, Georgia and they ALL LIE TO ME ABOUT EVERYTHING :(.I have filed complaints with Medicare and no one ever emails or calls, or writes me back. I believe UHC TINA S. who has inserted her Name on MY PHONE in Auto-fill as being at my Home Address and my Cell number is STEALING ALL OF MY CALLS AND EMAILS. I TRULY DO! How did this TINA S. get herself onto my private cellphone Auto-fill, when I try to enter MY Name it comes up as TINA S. This woman is a LIAR! As someone who lives independently and pays my own bills, and who has endured severe abuse; my independence matters. These controlling tactics by UHC are disturbing!The SEVERE PAIN BY THEM LYING TO ME IS VERY VERY BAD! THEY CAUSE ME to have MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS' just with their Messed up games and manipulation of my LIFE. Calling them at any time on any day leads to constant crisis and pain and suffering because they ARGUE, Waste my time - they do not do their job. I feel like I am calling 1-800-IDIOTS-R-US when I call them for anything. There appears to be Zero Government oversight or regulation regarding UHC Medicare's egregious misuse of Government funding.I have lost all hope in this Insurance company to ever do the right thing. It appears a bunch of Crooks and Clowns are running this Company that gets paid Millions of Government dollars in order to Care for its Members. I am a Member and they have caused me SEVERE PAIN AND SUFFERING ALL YEAR LONG. They have not helped me get the Care that I have begged and begged them for; very often crying, in severe mental distress. They want me to have a complete mental breakdown. To cause suffering of me is a terrible thing to do to me. I do not deserve their cruelty! No one does!"
92,"I called to inquire about my payment. After being transferred 3 times and 45 minutes later I was told I was talking to the wrong department. I was then transferred to the prescription department and disconnected. I called back the next day and told the agent what I was calling about, transferred to billing who didn't speak clear English, put on hold 3 times and finally after 1,5 hrs have up and hung up."
93,I called UHC last week to ask for counselling services. I was asked a series of questions then I was placed on hold without any notice just to be transferred from place to place for about 5 hours! Run!
94,"I contacted UHC for pre-approval for an appointment with Psychologist. They told me that all the ""out of network"" Psychologist services are fully covered in my plan. But after submitting the bills I was told that any consultation greater than 59 mins is not covered. Most of the consultation are for 1 hr so the limit of 59 mins was kept intentionally to reject the claims. That was also not explained during preapproval. Another issue mentioned by them to reject the claim was that the tax_id number should be of the doctor and not the facility. This was also not explained in advance."
95,"DO NOT USE THIS INSURANCE CARRIER if you plan on doing anything more than regular Dr. visits. Anything past routine Dr. visits will not be honored/covered, despite what they say. I have a Dr saying I need a surgery for my health and the chat rep said it was covered but when it came to the Dr. to verify coverage they have declined it twice. What am I paying for?!?!"
96,"They told me my plan would cover extraction, found out from dentist it doesn't. So I called UHC again, got additional coverage, they said would cover extraction but not so again. So I went round and round with them and now they say the manager call me in 2 days. They didn't want to switch me because I changed once already but it's because of you people at uhc who do not know your own plans well at all. Bad experience."
97,"The price is way too high for the coverage and the out of pocket expenses. Especially since people on the market place get it for little to no cost. By the time it’s all said and done, all of my income goes to medical bills. We make too much to qualify and not enough to survive. It’s not right, especially when you get closer to retirement."
98,United Healthcare’s Insurance plan has helped me cover all of my necessary health requirements plus offers the added benefits of annual health maintenance assessments which I just learned covers my monthly gym membership as well.
99,"So, I am 74 years old, retired with a pension from the Teachers Retirement System of Texas (TRS). I retired in 2002 and at that time TRS provided deal, vision and health insurance in different tiers of care. The higher the level you chose the more the premium cost. Three years into retirement and the dental and vision had gone away and the premiums for health care were more than I could afford. As soon as I was eligible for Medicare, I opted out of TRS and went with United Health Care the AARP program. Wow, what a difference. Health care, prescription drugs, dental and vision coverage all at a cost I could afford. All was well until I hit 73 years of age, now here I sit after three strokes and a heart attack. Still covered by the same policy.Yes I have had to pay my share but I am able to do that thanks to my retirement and supplemental coverage by the Veterans Administration, Army Veteran 68-69, and the premiums have not gone up. If I have a question, or I think a doctor is gouging me, I call United Health Care and they take care of the problem. They are really more than my insurance provider, they are my advocate for my health care needs. I don't even think about my health insurance anymore. I know it is covered."
100,"Great insurance overall, however I received a statement through mail, from a doctor in Nashville TN. Not detailing what the visit was for and dated 1-10-21. More detailed billing information on statements would be helpful."
